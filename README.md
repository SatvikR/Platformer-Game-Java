# Platformer-Game-Java

This is platformer game that is made with the java-swing library. <br>
This project spawned out of my hatred for unity (I'm just bad at it) <br>
I wrote all the physics myself (which is why it is so bad) <br>
The GameLoop.java is a modified version of http://www.java-gaming.org/index.php?topic=24220.0
